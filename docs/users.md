One of the services offered by EGI is the [Workload Manager](https://www.egi.eu/service/workload-manager/) which is a DIRAC service. It provides both workload and data management components allowing users to execute jobs in the EGI sites as well as manage their distributed data. The [EGI Workload Manager](https://dirac.egi.eu) is serving about 20 scientific communities from various scientific domains, some of them counting more than thousand users. The service is hosted on the premises of the [IN2P3 Computing Center, Lyon](https://cc.in2p3.fr/en/) and is operated by a team of administrators from several CNRS laboratories. In 2024, more than 30 millions user jobs were executed with the help of the EGI Workload Manager service.
